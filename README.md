# ScholarChains

**Decentralized Scholarly Publishing on Nostr with OpenTimestamps**

ScholarChains is a censorship-resistant research publishing platform that combines three proven protocols:
- **Nostr** for metadata distribution
- **Blossom** for content-addressable file storage
- **OpenTimestamps** for Bitcoin-based cryptographic timestamping

## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Publish Research Papers**: Upload PDFs to Blossom, publish metadata to Nostr
- **Peer Review System**: Write signed, public reviews with ratings and verdicts
- **OpenTimestamps**: Every paper and review gets a cryptographic timestamp proof anchored to Bitcoin
- **Timestamp Verification**: Verify and download .ots proof files for offline validation
- **Lightning Tips**: Reward authors and reviewers with instant micro-payments
- **Reputation System**: Build credibility through quality contributions
- **Search & Discovery**: Find papers by topic, author, subject classification

### Technical Highlights
- Custom Nostr event kinds (32623 for papers, 4597 for reviews)
- NIP-B7 Blossom integration for decentralized file storage
- NIP-57 Lightning zaps for direct payments
- OpenTimestamps integration for tamper-proof timestamps (zero on-chain costs)
- Calendar server aggregation for efficient Bitcoin anchoring
- Full TypeScript type safety
- React 18 with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui

## 📚 Documentation

See `/NIP.md` for the complete protocol specification including:
- Event kind definitions
- Tag schemas
- OpenTimestamps implementation details
- File storage with Blossom
- Security considerations and verification processes

## ⚠️ OpenTimestamps Implementation Note

**Current Status**: The OpenTimestamps functionality is currently implemented with mock functions for UI/UX demonstration purposes.

**Why**: The `opentimestamps` npm package is a CommonJS library that's incompatible with Vite's ESM bundler. Multiple workaround attempts (dynamic imports, Vite plugins, etc.) were unsuccessful due to fundamental module system incompatibilities.

**Production Implementation Required**: To use real OpenTimestamps cryptographic timestamping, you need to implement a backend API endpoint:

```typescript
// Example Node.js backend endpoint
POST /api/timestamp
{
  "data": "string to timestamp",
  "calendars": ["https://alice.btc.calendar.opentimestamps.org", ...]
}

// Returns
{
  "proof": "base64-encoded OTS proof",
  "info": { "isPending": true }
}
```

The backend can use the `opentimestamps` library in Node.js where CommonJS modules work correctly. The frontend would call this API instead of using the library directly.

**Alternative Solutions**:
1. Create a Node.js backend service (recommended)
2. Use WebAssembly-based OTS implementation (if available)
3. Reimplement OTS protocol in TypeScript (complex)

See `src/lib/opentimestamps.ts` for implementation details and TODOs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

**Production**:
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d app

# Access at http://localhost
```

**Development with HMR**:
```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
docker-compose up app-dev

# Access at http://localhost:8080
```

See [Docker Guide](docs/DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Local Development

**Development**:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Build for Production**:
```bash
npm run build
```

**Run Tests**:
```bash
npm test
```

    ["t", "topic2"]
  ]
}
```

**Kind 4597: Peer Review (Regular)**
```json

  "kind": 4597,
  "content": "## Review\n\nDetailed feedback...",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "32623:author-pubkey:paper-id"],
    ["p", "author-pubkey"],
    ["ots", "BE9wcGVuc...base64-encoded-opentimestamps-proof..."],
    ["verdict", "accept"],
    ["rating", "8"],
    ["aspect", "methodology"],
    ["aspect", "novelty"]
  ]
}
```
