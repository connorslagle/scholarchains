## Overview

ScholarChains is a decentralized scholarly publishing platform built on three core technologies:
- **Nostr** - Censorship-resistant metadata distribution
- **Blossom** - Content-addressable file storage
- **OpenTimestamps** - Bitcoin-based cryptographic timestamping

Unlike traditional academic publishing where gatekeepers control access, ScholarChains creates a permissionless, transparent, and incentive-aligned ecosystem where all participants benefit from open science.

## Stakeholder Perspectives

### 1. üë®‚Äçüî¨ **Authors** (Paper Publishers)

**Who they are:**
- Researchers, academics, independent scientists
- Anyone with original research to share
- Graduate students, postdocs, professors, industry researchers

**What they want:**
- Permanent, censorship-resistant publication
- Provable timestamps to establish priority
- Recognition and credit for their work
- Fair, transparent peer review
- Direct financial support from the community

**How they interact with the protocol:**

#### Step 1: Prepare the Paper
```
1. Write research paper (PDF format)
2. Prepare metadata:
   - Title and abstract
   - Subject classification (e.g., cs.CR, physics.gen-ph)
   - Keywords/topics
   - License (e.g., CC-BY-4.0)
   - Optional: DOI, arXiv ID
```

#### Step 2: Upload to Blossom
```
1. Log in with Nostr identity (browser extension or key)
2. Select PDF file (max 50MB)
3. File is uploaded to configured Blossom servers
4. Receive content-addressable hash (SHA-256)
```

**Technical detail:** Multiple Blossom servers can be configured for redundancy. If one server fails, the upload automatically tries the next one.

#### Step 3: Create OpenTimestamps Proof
```
1. System generates unique data string:
   paper-id:title:blob-hash:timestamp
2. Backend creates OpenTimestamps proof
3. Proof submitted to Bitcoin calendar servers
4. Proof anchored to Bitcoin blockchain (within 1-24 hours)
```

**Technical detail:** This provides cryptographic proof that the paper existed at a specific time, preventing backdating. No transaction fees required.

#### Step 4: Publish Nostr Event
```
Event Kind: 32623 (addressable event)
Tags:
- d: unique paper ID
- title: paper title
- summary: abstract
- published_at: Unix timestamp
- ots: base64-encoded OpenTimestamps proof
- h: Blossom blob SHA-256 hash
- url: Blossom server URL
- subject: classification code
- t: topic keywords
- license: license identifier
```

**What happens next:**
- Event is broadcast to all connected Nostr relays
- Paper appears in global feed within seconds
- Anyone can discover and read the paper
- Reviews start coming in
- Zaps (tips) can be received

**Benefits for authors:**
- ‚úÖ Instant publication (no waiting for journal acceptance)
- ‚úÖ Permanent record on Bitcoin blockchain
- ‚úÖ Censorship-resistant (no single point of failure)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Graduate Student Publishing First Paper

**Using ScholarChains:**

1. **Day 1 - Publication:**
   - Alice logs in with her Nostr key
   - Uploads her PDF (23MB)
   - Fills in metadata (title, abstract, keywords: "quantum-computing", "cryptography")
   - Clicks "Publish Paper"
   - Within 30 seconds, her paper is live
   - She shares the link on Twitter, Nostr, and her university mailing list

2. **Day 2 - First Review:**
   - Dr. Bob, a quantum computing expert, sees Alice's paper
   - He downloads and reads it
   - Writes a detailed review: "Excellent methodology, novel approach to quantum key distribution"
   - Gives verdict: "accept", rating: 9/10
   - Review appears publicly

3. **Day 7 - Building Traction:**
   - 5 reviews received (4 positive, 1 suggesting improvements)
   - 127 people have downloaded the paper
   - Alice receives 50,000 sats in zaps (~$15)
   - Paper cited in 2 other ScholarChains papers
   - OpenTimestamps proof confirmed in Bitcoin block

4. **Month 1 - Recognition:**
   - Alice has verifiable proof of publication priority
   - Can cite the work in her thesis defense
   - Reputation growing in the community
   - Traditional journal now interested (sees the reviews)

**Outcome:** Alice's work gets recognized on merit, not journal politics. She has permanent, timestamped proof of her contribution.

### Scenario 2: Established Professor Providing Peer Review

**Context:** Dr. Carol is a tenured professor with 20 years of experience. She spends ~10 hours/month on peer review for traditional journals, never gets paid or credited.

**Using ScholarChains:**

1. **Discovery:**
   - Carol follows the "physics.gen-ph" tag on ScholarChains
   - Sees new paper on quantum field theory
   - Topic aligns with her expertise

2. **Review Process:**
   - Downloads paper (3MB PDF)
   - Reads over 2 days
   - Identifies 3 major issues and 5 minor suggestions
   - Writes comprehensive 1,500-word review
   - Publishes review (verdict: "revise", rating: 6/10)

3. **Recognition:**
   - Review appears with her name attached
   - Author responds to her critique publicly
   - Other researchers see her expertise
   - Receives 25,000 sats in zaps from grateful readers
   - Review cited in subsequent papers

4. **Long-term Benefits:**
   - Over 6 months: 15 reviews published
   - Total zaps received: 500,000 sats (~$150)
   - Verifiable review history
   - Consulting opportunities from high-quality reviews
   - Graduate students want to work with her (reputation)

**Outcome:** Carol gets credit and compensation for work she was doing anyway. Her expertise is publicly recognized.

### Scenario 3: Independent Researcher Without Institutional Access

**Context:** Dave is a brilliant researcher who left academia but continues research independently. He can't access papers behind paywalls and can't publish in traditional journals without affiliation.

**Using ScholarChains:**

1. **Access:**
   - Dave browses ScholarChains freely
   - Downloads any paper without paywalls
   - Reads 50+ papers in his field
   - Verifies timestamps to ensure legitimacy

2. **Contribution:**
   - Dave writes a paper on a breakthrough he discovered
   - No affiliation required
   - Publishes to ScholarChains
   - Bitcoin timestamp proves priority

3. **Review:**
   - Receives 8 reviews within 2 weeks
   - Mix of positive and constructive criticism
   - Revises paper based on feedback
   - Publishes version 2 (same paper ID, new version)

4. **Recognition:**
   - Paper gets noticed by researchers at major labs
   - Cited in follow-up work
   - Dave receives 1M sats in zaps ($300)
   - Offered consulting opportunities

**Outcome:** Dave contributes to science without institutional barriers. His work is judged on merit alone.

### Scenario 4: Reader Evaluating Paper Quality

**Context:** Eve is a grad student researching a specific topic. She finds a paper on ScholarChains and wants to assess if it's credible.

**Evaluation Process:**

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Reads title and abstract
   - Checks subject classification
   - Sees publication date

2. **Quality Signals:**
   - Reads 7 peer reviews
   - Notes: 5 "accept", 1 "revise", 1 "comment"
   - Average rating: 7.8/10
   - Reviewers mention strong methodology

3. **Reviewer Credibility:**
   - Checks reviewer profiles
   - Sees they have 20+ quality reviews each
   - Recognized names in the field
   - High zap counts (community trust)

4. **Cryptographic Verification:**
   - Downloads .ots proof file
   - Verifies against Bitcoin blockchain
   - Confirms paper was published when claimed
   - Checks Blossom hash matches PDF

5. **Citation Graph:**
   - Sees paper cited by 12 other papers
   - Follow-up work validates findings
   - Author has 15 other publications

**Decision:** Eve determines the paper is high quality and trustworthy. She cites it in her own work.

The protocol combines the best aspects of traditional peer review (expert evaluation, quality control) with modern decentralized technology (Bitcoin, Lightning, Nostr) to create a system that is:

- **Fast:** Publish in seconds
- **Fair:** No editorial bias
- **Free:** Open access for all
- **Permanent:** Stored forever
- **Verifiable:** Cryptographically provable
- **Incentivized:** Everyone gets rewarded

This is not just a technical improvement‚Äîit's a fundamental reimagining of how scientific knowledge should be created, evaluated, and shared. ScholarChains puts control back in the hands of researchers and readers, where it belongs.
